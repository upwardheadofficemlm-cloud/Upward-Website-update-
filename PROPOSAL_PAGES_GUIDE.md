# Proposal Pages Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the new proposal pages system that allows you to create private, non-indexed proposal pages that can only be accessed via direct URL.

## Features

- **Private Access**: Proposal pages are not indexed by search engines
- **Direct URL Access**: Can be accessed via specific URLs
- **CMS Integration**: All content is editable through the CMS system
- **Multiple Proposal Types**: Support for different types of proposals
- **Custom IDs**: Each proposal can have a unique identifier

## URL Structure

The proposal pages follow this URL pattern:

```
/proposals/{proposal-type}/{proposal-id}
```

### Examples:

1. **Digital Marketing Proposal**:
   ```
   /proposals/digital-marketing/client-abc-123
   /proposals/digital-marketing/company-xyz-456
   ```

2. **Web Development Proposal**:
   ```
   /proposals/web-development/project-def-789
   /proposals/web-development/website-uvw-012
   ```

3. **Generic Proposal** (for any other type):
   ```
   /proposals/brand-identity/client-ghi-345
   /proposals/social-media/company-jkl-678
   /proposals/content-creation/project-mno-901
   ```

## SEO Protection

All proposal pages are protected from search engine indexing through:

2. **Robots.txt**: `/proposals/` directory is disallowed
3. **No Sitemap**: Proposal pages are not included in sitemap

## CMS Integration

All proposal content is editable through the CMS system. Each proposal uses unique IDs for content elements:

- **Digital Marketing**: `digital-marketing-{id}-*`
- **Web Development**: `web-development-{id}-*`
- **Generic**: `{proposal-type}-{id}-*`

### Editable Sections Include:

- Hero title and subtitle
- Executive summary
- Project overview

- Expected results
- Timeline
- Investment details
- Next steps
- Contact information
